description: "A local-first knowledge management system that creates persistent semantic graphs from AI conversations"

Basic Memory helps you get control of your knowledge using LLMs. All knowledge is stored in standard Markdown files on your computer, giving you full control and
ownership of your data.

Basic Memory connects you and AI assistants through shared knowledge:

1. **Captures knowledge** from natural conversations with AI assistants
2. **Structures information** using simple semantic patterns in Markdown
3. **Enables knowledge reuse** across different conversations and sessions
4. **Maintains persistence** through local files you control completely

Both you and AI assistants like Claude can read from and write to the same knowledge base, creating a continuous
learning environment where each conversation builds upon previous ones.

## Pick up your conversation right where you left off

- AI assistants can load context from local files in a new conversation
- Notes are saved locally as Markdown files in real time
- No project knowledge or special prompting required

Basic Memory uses:

- **Files as the source of truth** - Everything is stored in plain Markdown files
- **Git-compatible storage** - All knowledge can be versioned, branched, and merged
- **Local SQLite database** - For fast indexing and searching only (not primary storage)
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - For seamless AI assistant integration

Changes to files automatically sync with the knowledge graph, and AI assistants can see your edits in conversations.
